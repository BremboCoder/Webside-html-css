            <p class="homep">Morocco, a melting pot of dynasties and cultures :
                Each country has its own history: historical facts, events and important milestones that gave the
                country its true historical value. The history of a country is one of the events considered worthy of
                remembrance, which perfectly applies to Morocco. With several dynasties that have succeeded one another
                over the years: the Idrisside dynasty, the Almoravid dynasty, the Almohad dynasty, the Merinid dynasty,
                the Saadian dynasty and the Alaouite dynasty, Morocco has gained international consideration as a
                multicultural country, with several types of heritage recognized as World Heritage by UNESCO. Morocco is
                one of the go-to destinations for discovery lovers, the most fascinated by nature, history, the art of
                living and Moroccan hospitality. The experience gained during their journeys in Morocco leave them
                pleasantly satisfied with their stay.</p>

            <p class="foodp">Morocco's culinary heritage embraces the deep-rooted traditions and cultural variety of the
                country. Couscous, Tajine, Pastilla, Mrouzia, and R'fissa, are some of the emblematic dishes of the
                country that you canâ€™t resist. Subtly composed of a wide variety of striking flavours and scents,
                Moroccan cuisine draws its originality from a combination between Berber, Arab-Andalusian, and Jewish
                culinary traditions. Thanks to its rich cultural heritage specific to each region, Morocco has built an
                undisputed reputation worldwide.</p>
